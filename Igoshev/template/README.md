Ok so I guess you are reading this cuz you wanna use my code. There are some
functions that do stuff and that:

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    9

and this other part prints the Fibonacci series:

    >>> fibonnaccci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

If you can't use it, its kind of your problem, not mine!

Have a nice astrohacking day!
