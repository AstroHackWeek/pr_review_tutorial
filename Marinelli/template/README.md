This code has two functions. The first function gives the factorial of a given number.

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    3628800

The second function gives all Fibonacci numbers up to a maximum value.

    >>> fibonacci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

Good luck!
