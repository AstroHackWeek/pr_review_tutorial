This branch has two python code, in the first one there are some
functions that do:

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    9

in the second one there is computation but it will give some bugs:

    >>> fibonnaccci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
