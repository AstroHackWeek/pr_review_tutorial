In this code there are two functions doing some mathematical operations. The first one finds the factorial of a given number. An example how to use it is listedbelow: 

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    9

The other one is finding all the numbers in the Fibonnaci sequence up to the given number, i.e.:

    >>> fibonnaccci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

If you have troubles using it please open an issue or submit a pull request.
