This folder contains two Python scripts: simple\_functions.py and buggy\_function.py.

Simple functions
----------------

Factorial
~~~~~~~~~

There is a function for computing the factorial of an integer number:

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    9

Fibonnacci
~~~~~~~~~
and this other part does something.  I forget why that I did it:

There is a function for computing the Fibonnacci numbers lower than a given integer:

    >>> from simple_functions import fibonnacci
    >>> fibonnacci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
