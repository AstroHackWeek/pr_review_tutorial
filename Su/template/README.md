There are two functions in the simple_functions module. See below examples:

USAGE:
1. The function factorial()
   ```python
   from simple_functions import factorial
   factorial(10)
   ```
   It should print out 3628800

2. The function fibonacci()
   ```python
   from simple_functions import fibonacci
   fibonacci(100)
   ```
   It should print out [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
