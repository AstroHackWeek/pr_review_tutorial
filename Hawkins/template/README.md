Here are several key functions, which includes the ability for the user to compute the factorial of a number as well as disply a Fibonacci sequence. Exmaples of both functions are below:

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    3628800
	>>> factorial(5)
    120


The second function displays the Fibonacci sequence up to and including the largest number not larger than the input number:

    >>> fibonnaccci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

If you can't use it, send an raise an issue or send me an email so we can figure it out.
