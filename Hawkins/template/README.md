Ok so I guess you are reading this cuz you wanna use my code. There are some
functions that do stuf and thats:

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    3628800
	>>> factorial(5)
    120
and this other part does computes the factorial of the input. The second function determines the fibonnaccci sequence up to the input number

    >>> fibonnaccci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

If you can't use it, send an raise an issue so we can figure it out.
