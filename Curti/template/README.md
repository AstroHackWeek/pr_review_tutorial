This is a REAMDE file for AstroHackWeek day 2. 
There are some examples of very simple functions :

    >>> from simple_functions import factorial
    >>> factorial(10)
    9

and :

    >>> fibonnaccci(100)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

Test them and in case they are not working, check out the relative scripts to spot the errors in the code.
